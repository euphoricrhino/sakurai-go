## Content

* `hydrogen-radial`: computes the arbitrary precision closed-form formula for the radial wavefunction of hydrogen atom.
* `spherical-harmonics`: computes the arbitrary precision closed-form formula for the spherical harmonics.
* `render-hydrogen`: renders hydrogen electron probability density with arbitrary precision computation.
* `spherical-bessel`: computes the arbitrary precision closed-form formula for the spherical bessel functions.
* `resonance-scattering`: plots the resonance scattering for the partial waves of constant spherical well potential, this reproduces Figure 6.15, and allows to plot with different parameter values.
* `kohn-sham`: carries out the detailed calculation of helium atom ground state based on the recipe given by the density function theory, and kohn-sham equation. This fills all the gaps left in section 7.6.5 and reproduces table 7.1 and figure 7.1
